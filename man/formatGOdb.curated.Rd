\title{Generates new GO database from curated evidence-codes only for functional enrichment using run.topGO.meta.}
\usage{
formatGOdb.curated(url, organism = "Pf", plasmoDB_version = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{url or filepath to a .gaf or gz-compressed gaf file. This should be the complete GO.gaf file (not one that has "Curated" in the PlasmoDB filename).}

\item{organism}{optional string to include in your output filename. Defaults to "Pf".}

\item{plasmoDB_version}{= optional string to include the PlasmoDB release version in your output filename (e.g. "v68").}
}
\description{
Generates new GO database from curated evidence-codes only for functional enrichment using run.topGO.meta.
}
\details{
Outputs a dated file named "*_GOdb.out" to the ./Routput folder. ./Routput will be created if it doesn't already exist.

You will need to run \code{topGO::readmappings()} on the file generated with formatGOdb to use it as the geneID2GO parameter.

Example: geneID2GO <- topGO::readmappings("./Routput/Pf_Mar022022_GOdb.out")
}
\section{\strong{Notes on gaf.gz format}}{
The .gaf or .gaf.gz file should be in tabular format with 17 columns, one row for each GO term associated with a geneID. No formatting is necessary when using the provided url. Note that zip archives (extension: .zip) won't work directly with this function. Zip files need to be downloaded and unzipped, then the 'url' argument should be updated to the local unzipped file path.

A GOdb from Plasmo DB's \emph{P. falciparum} annotation (from PlasmoDB release 68; accessed July 29, 2025) pre-formatted using this function and ready for run.topGO.meta is included in this package (Pfal_geneID2GO_curated).
