Description: Handy functions and datasets specifically enabling Plasmodium falciparum functional enrichment analyses.
    You provide a single list of all genes included with your experiment and how you categorized them (e.g. upregulated,
    downregulated,neutral); then pfGO will test each category for functional enrichment. pfGO acts as a wrapper around
    the topGO package for much of its enrichment functionality, while also providing several functions for incorporating
    latest gene-ontology and functional annotations directly from PlasmoDB.org. pfGO enables chaining together many
    parallel enrichment-analyses at once, generating thorough logs and outputs supporting reproducible analyses.
