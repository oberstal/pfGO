Description: Handy functions and datasets specifically enabling Plasmodium
    falciparum functional enrichment analyses.  You provide a single list
    of all genes included with your experiment and how you categorized
    them (e.g. upregulated, downregulated,neutral); then pfGO will test
    each category for functional enrichment. pfGO acts as a wrapper around
    the topGO package for much of its enrichment functionality, while also
    providing several functions for incorporating latest gene-ontology and
    functional annotations directly from PlasmoDB.org. pfGO enables
    chaining together many parallel enrichment-analyses at once,
    generating thorough logs and outputs supporting reproducible analyses.
